The shortwave (SW) radiation module is based on A\+ER Rapid Radiative Transfer Model version 2 (R\+R\+T\+M2) with N\+C\+EP updates/modification. This package includes N\+C\+EP modifications of the R\+R\+T\+M\+G\+\_\+\+SW v3.\+8, a correlated k-\/distribution shortwave radiative transfer model developed at A\+ER, Inc. for application to G\+C\+Ms. This version of R\+R\+T\+M\+G\+\_\+\+SW utilizes a two-\/stream radiative transfer method as implemented at E\+C\+M\+WF. A maximum-\/random cloud overlap is used, consistent with the maximum-\/random overlap used in the R\+R\+T\+M-\/\+LW. The SW aerosol single scattering albedo and asymmetry factor now reflect more recent data. The version of R\+R\+T\+M\+G-\/\+SW provided here utilizes a reduced complement of 112 g-\/points, which is half of the 224 g-\/points used in the standard R\+R\+T\+M\+\_\+\+SW, and a two-\/stream method for radiative transfer. In N\+C\+EP N\+E\+M\+S/\+G\+SM, hourly calculations are conducted in both LW and SW modules.\hypertarget{SW_RRTMG}{}\section{S\+W bands}\label{SW_RRTMG}
