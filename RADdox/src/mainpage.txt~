@section Introduction

Radiative process is one of the most complex and computational intensive part of all model physics. 
As an essential part of model physics, it directly and indirectly connects all physics processes with model dynamics, 
and regulates the overall earth-atmosphere energy exchanges and transformations. The radiation package in NEMS physics
has standardized component modules. The schematic radiation module structure is shown in table 1.

Radiation parameterizations are intended to provide a fast and accurate method of determined the total radiative 
flux at any given location. These calculations provide both the total radiative flux at the ground surface, which is 
needed for the surface energy budget, and the vertical radiative flux divergence, which is used to calculate the 
radiative heating and cooling rates of a given atmospheric volume. The magnitude of the terms in the surface energy 
budget can set the stage for moist deep convection and are crucial to the formation of low-level clouds. In addition, 
the vertical radiative flux divergence can produce substantial cooling, particularly at the tops of clouds, which can 
have strong dynamic effect on cloud evolution.

The shortwave radiation parameterization is based on Chou and Suarez (1999) and was modified by Hou et al.(2002) for the GFS. It contains eight spectral bands in the ultraviolet and visible region and one spectral band in the near-infrared region. It includes absorption by ozone, water vapor,carbon dioxide, and oxygen. A random-maximum cloud overlapping is assumed for radiative transfer calculations in the operational GFS. Cloud optical depth is parameterized as a function of the predicted cloud condensate path and the effective radius of cloud particles (\f$r_e\f$). Cloud particle single-scattering albedo and asymmetry factors are functions of \f$r_e\f$. For water droplets. \f$r_e\f$ is fixed at \f$10\mu m\f$ over the ocean, and specified as \f$r_e=min[max(5-0.25T_c , 5),10]\mu m\f$ over land, where \f$T_c\f$ is temperature in degrees Celsius. For ice particles, \f$r_e\f$ is an empirical function of ice water content and temperature that follows Heymsfield and McFarquhar (1996). The radiative effects of rain and snow are not included in the operational GFS, but the direct radiative effect of atmospheric aerosols is included. The surface albedo over land varies with the surface type, solar spectral band, and season, and is further adjusted by a solar zenith-angle-dependent factor for the direct solar beam. When the ground has snow cover the grid-mean surface albedo is first computed separately for snow-free and snow-covered areas, and then combined using a snow-cover fraction that depends on the surface roughness and snow depth. Snow albedo depends on the solar zenith angle (Briegleb 1992).

A major change was made in longwave radiation on 28 August 2003. The Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) model (Schwarzkopf and Fels 1991) was replaced by the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model (RRTM; Mlawer et al. 1997). The RRTM computes longwave absorption and emission by water vapor,carbon dioxide,ozone,cloud particles, and various trace gases including \f$N_2O\f$,\f$CH_4\f$,\f$O_2\f$,and four types of halocarbons[chlorofluorocarbons(CFCs)].Aerosol effects are not included.For consistency with the earlier GFDL module, no trace gases are included in the RRTM for the GFS forecasts. The RRTM uses a correlated-k distribution method and a transmittance lookup table that is linearly scaled by optical depth to achieve high accuracy and efficiency. The algorithm contains 140 unevenly distributed intervals in 16 spectral bands. It employs the Clough-Kneizys-Davies (CKD_2.4) continuum model (Clough et al. 1992) to compute absorption by water vapor at the continuum band. Longwave cloud radiative properties external to the RRTM depend on cloud liquid/ice water path and the effective radius of ice particles and water droplets (Hu and Stamnes 1993; Ebert and Curry 1992).
