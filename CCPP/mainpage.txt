	Documentation for the operational physics suite can be found here. As of January 2016, the following schemes are used:
	- Radiation - RRTMG
	- Turbulent Transport (PBL) - Hybrid EDMF
	- Penetrative Convection - SAS
	- Shallow Convection - SAS
	- Cloud Microphysics - Zhao-Carr
	- Gravity Wave Drag - Orographic GWD, Stationary Convective GWD
	- Ozone Physics - NRL simplified scheme
	- Land Surface Model - NOAH

	Here, each scheme is documented in its own module.
