/**
@page scm Using the IPD with the SCM 


GMTB has developed a Single Column Model (SCM) for the purpose of testing physical parameterizations in an environment that is model agnostic. Currently the SCM uses the GFS time-stepping and vertical grid to run idealized cases, and it can be modified to include other schemes. 

The implementation of the IPD in the Single Column Model allows developers who wish to incorporate and evaluate physics changes using the IPD to do so in a simplified framework independent of a full forecast system. It may also bring insight into the implementation of the IPD for those developers who wish to implement it within their dycore. 

More information about the SCM and its implemenation of the IPD can be found here: <a href="http://www.dtcenter.org/GMTB/gmtb_scm_doc/index.html"> GMTB Single Column Model</a>
